# Matlab Parallel Server

## About
Matlab Parallel Server allows you to launch jobs on the cluster from within a Matlab session, both when using Matlab in the command line or or from the GUI. For now, 
this is only possible when launchin a Matlab instance on the cluster, but in the future it will also be possible to submit jobs from your Matlab desktop client.

Matlab Parallel Server is available from Matlab R2022a+. 

> **_NOTE:_**  TO DETERMINE: what users can get access to Matlab?

## Configuration

Before being able to use Matlab Parallel Server, you have to go through some configuration steps.

### On the cluster
As to avoid cluttering on the login nodes, you should start by launching an interactive job. This will also allow you to immediately test this connection
